Release Notes
=============

Changes between tagged Emscripten versions are recorded in the :ref:`ChangeLog`.
This log includes high-level information about new features, user-oriented
fixes, options, command-line parameters, usage changes, deprecations,
significant internal modifications, optimizations, etc. The log for each version
links to a detailed diff report, which lists all the incremental changes since
the previous release.

In addition, the mailing list is used to announce each new :term:`SDK` release;
these announcements include additional informal release notes and "highlights"
information. The easiest way to find these posts is to use `this search
