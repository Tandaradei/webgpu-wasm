This section contains articles that are specific to the site, or which do not belong in any other category.

.. COMMENT (not rendered):: This isn't actually displayed anywhere, except on the documentation home. In the main sidebar the link is to the "About" document below (which is most important) and the glossary is not shown. This is intentional.
