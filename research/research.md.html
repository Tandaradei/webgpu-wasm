# WebGPU
https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/ (Specification)

https://github.com/gpuweb (Github)

## Implementations
### wgpu (Mozilla)
https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu

Native WebGPU implementation based on gfx-hal

This is an experimental WebGPU implementation, exposing both Rust and C interfaces as a native static library. It's written in Rust and is based on gfx-hal and a few Rendy bits. See the upstream WebGPU specification (work in progress).

The implementation consists of the following parts:

* wgpu-core - internal Rust API for WebGPU implementations to use
* wgpu-native - the native implementation of WebGPU as a C API library
* wgpu-remote - remoting layer to work with WebGPU across the process boundary, as a C API library used by Gecko
* ffi - the C headers generated by cbindgen for the native headers

#### Dependencies
Before getting started with Wgpu, there are some necessary components that have to be installed and configured.

* Rust compiler
* C compiler
    * GCC
    * MSBuild
* GLFW 3

### Dawn (Google)
https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn

Dawn is an open-source and cross-platform implementation of the work-in-progress WebGPU standard. More precisely it implements webgpu.h that is a one-to-one mapping with the WebGPU IDL. Dawn is meant to be integrated as part of a larger system and is the underlying implementation of WebGPU in Chromium.

Dawn provides several WebGPU building blocks:
 * WebGPU C/C++ headers that applications and other building blocks use.
    * The webgpu.h version that Dawn implements.
    * A C++ wrapper for the webgpu.h.
* A “native” implementation of WebGPU using platforms' GPU APIs:
    * D3D12 on Windows 10
    * Metal on macOS and iOS
    * Vulkan on Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, Android and Fuchsia
OpenGL as best effort where available
A client-server implementation of WebGPU for applications that are in a sandbox without access to native drivers

Emscripten is a toolchain for compiling to asm.js and WebAssembly, built using LLVM, that lets you run C and C++ on the web at near-native speed without plugins.
